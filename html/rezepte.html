        First add 250g of rama butter and 250g of sugar in a bowl. Then beat the whole thing thoroughly with a hand mixer for about 3 minutes. Then add 400g of white flour and beat the whole mixture again for 5 minutes. Then take the dough out and knead the dough into a ball. It will then wrapped in a plastic wrap and stored in the freezer compartment. The dough has to be refrigerated for one hour.

        After an hour, take the dough out and knead it again. When this has been done, you should roll out the dough with a pastry roller.

        These cookies should soon be distributed on a baking tray. All biscuits should then be well coated with protein of an egg.

        The oven must be preheated and the cookies must bake for 15-20 minutes.

    <p>
        In the meantime, the icing can be prepared. Because they were supposed to be Christmas cookies, I chose the colors green and red for the icing. To make the icing, mix 250g of powdered sugar with lemon juice and 3 tablespoons of lukewarm water until a paste is formed.

    After the cookies are baked make sure you let them cool off for a bit. After a few minutes you are ready to start with the decoration.
